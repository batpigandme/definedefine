Mill edition) only syntactic contribution of a name is its _referent_[^Mill1973]; cites Hobbes' definition that "a word taken at pleasure to serve for a mark which may raise in our mind a thought like to some thought we had before, and which being pronounced to others, may be to them a sign of what thought the speaker had before in his mind" (where denotation = reference, and connotation = meaning)
