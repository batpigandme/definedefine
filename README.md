* **_definiendum_**: the symbol, term, or phrase being defined  
* **_definiens_**: the symbol or group of symbols explaining the meaning of the _definiendum_  
* **_name_**: (J.S. Mill edition) only syntactic contribution of a name is its _referent_[^Mill1882]; cites Hobbes' definition that "a word taken at pleasure to serve for a mark which may raise in our mind a thought like to some thought we had before, and which being pronounced to others, may be to them a sign of what thought the speaker had before in his mind" (where _denotation_ = reference, and _connotation_ = meaning)
  - **_Syncategorematic terms_**: "Words which are not capable of being used as names, but only as parts of names" (p.53).  
  - **_Categorematic terms_**: "word[s] which could be used either as the subject or predicate of a proposition without being accompanied by any other word" (p.53).
